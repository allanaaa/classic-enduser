# Adding Lightbox to Omeka

**Step One: Get the Lightbox Package**

The first step is to [download the latest LightBox 2 package](http://lokeshdhakar.com/projects/lightbox2){target=_blank}, where you will find a quick explanation of how it works and how to get started.

**Step Two: Modify and Upload the LightBox Package**

Once you have the package, unzip it so you can upload the files into the correct places in your theme directory. We will need to upload the *img* folder, the *lightbox-2.6.min.js* file, and the *lightbox.css* file to the correct places in your theme's folder.

Upload the entire *img* folder to your theme's top directory. (Alternatively, you could upload the images to your theme's */images* directory, and modify the *lightbox.css* stylesheet to look for them there.)

Upload the *lightbox-2.6.min.js* file to */yourtheme/javascripts/vendor*.

Upload the *lightbox.css* file to */yourtheme/css*.

**Step Three: Modify your items/show.php file**

In the `yourtheme/items/show.php` file, add the following as the first line (before the line that begins `<?php echo head(`

   `<?php 
    queue_js_file('lightbox-2.6.min', 'javascripts/vendor');
    queue_css_file('lightbox');
    ?>`

Look for the line that calls `item_image_gallery`, and modify it so it looks like this:

`<div class="element-text"><?php echo item_image_gallery(array('link'=>array('data-lightbox'=>'lightbox')));Â ?></div>`

In your theme's configuration, make sure that the Item File Gallery option is checked.
